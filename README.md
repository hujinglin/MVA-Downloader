# MVA Downloader

This is a very simple tool only for downloading the resources on [MVA](https://mva.microsoft.com)

One reason for writting this tool is the subtitle could not be downloaded on the offical site, and you can download **.srt** file by this tool :)

### Useage
 
```
npm install
node bin/server
# then visit 127.0.0.1:3000 as follow
```
